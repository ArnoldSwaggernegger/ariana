## Project structure

At a high level, the structure loolks roughly like this: 

```
ariana/
  |- src/
  | |- app/
  | | |- <app logic>
  | | |- content/
  | | |- header/
  | | |- layers/
  | | |- toolbox/
  | | |- app.js
  | |- assets/
  | | |- <static files>
  | |- common/
  | | |- <reusable code>
  | |- sass/
  | | |- <style files>
  | | |- main.scss
  | | |- variables.scss
  | | |- other_sass.scss etc.
  |- bower.json
  |- build.config.js
  |- Gruntfile.js
  |- package.json
  |- server.js
```

A brief description of each entry
- `src/` - ariana sources
  - `app/` - is used for application specific code, e.g. templates and controllers
  - `assets/` - images etc.
  - `common/` - all code that is likely to be used by different modules
- `sass/` - all style files
  - `main.scss` main style file from which all others are included
  - `variables.scss` put ALL SASS variables here
  - `other_sass.scss etc.` all other sass files, one file should contain the styling for one "feature"
- `bower.json` - the list of bower dependencies
- `build.config.js` - settings for the grunt build system
- `Gruntfile.js` - grunt build script
- `package.json` - metadata about ariana, used by NPM
- `server.js - a simple node.js server


## Getting started
ariana runs on a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server. Installing ariana takes about 3 minutes.

#### Requirements
- Node.js
- git

#### Node.js
First of all, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

After installing Node.js enter the following in your terminal of choice:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ArnoldSwaggernegger/ariana.git
$ cd ariana
```

Now that you have the repository cloned enter

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

- `npm install` installs all node modules defined in `package.json`
- `bower install` installs all dependencies defined in `bower.json` to a path specified in `.bowerrc`
- `grunt watch` tells grunt (build system) to build ariana. The `watch` parameter lets grunt watch for changes to your files. Grunt will automatically rebuild and recompile when these changes are detected.
  - Grunt serves as a [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) server. You can install the `LiveReload` browser plugin to automatically refresh your browser when grunt rebuilds ariana (this is not necessary, only a comodity).
  - Grunt also minifies and combines javascript, css, etc.

#### Usage
To run ariana enter the following

```sh
$ node server.js
```

This will start a Node.js server on `localhost:3000` and serves the `build/` folder as main (the build folder is generated by grunt).

## Development
ariana is based on [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) and [WebGL](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl).
Please follow the following styleguides to ensure development of ariana goes smoothly.

#### git workflow
ariana uses git as version control system. When developing ariana refer to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ArnoldSwaggernegger/ariana/issues) to find userstories.
When using ariana and git:
- **never** push directly to master
- work on a new branch for every **feature**
  - when you are done with your feature send in a pull request to master
  - make sure the pull request can automatically merge
  - give a meaningful description for your pull request
- when fixing an issue refer to the `#issue_number` in your commit (example: `fixes #23 - height of header is now correct`).
- always provide a meaningful description with your commit (even when fixing issues).

#### HTML styleguide
- use double quotation marks `<class="classname">`, not `<class='classname'>`
- no spaces between types and attributes `<class="classname">`, not `<class = "classname">`
- keep tags lowercase `<div>`, not `<DIV>`
- use classes to style elements `<class="classname">`
- please refrain from using inline styles `<style="don't do this">`
- indentation is not necessary
- when you need to use indentation, use 4 spaces
- place every element on their own row (not necessary if row is very short)
```
<p>
text
</p>
```
- refrain from using a `<div>` when a `<span>` is also possible
- Please use opening and closing tags for all elements, `<img></img>` not `<img />`

#### CSS/SASS styleguide
- indentation is 4 spaces
- for connecting classnames use a dash -, not camelCase
- give meaningful names to classes
- please follow the following class and element layout
```
element { 
    property: value;
    property: value;
    
    .nested_class {
        property: value;
    }
    
    element, .class {
        property: value;
    }
}
```
- Note that SASS allows for nested class defenitions. However, don't overdo nesting
- stylesheets are split up into modules (widgets, headers, etc.). All variables will be combined into one file. A main file will import every other file.
- when adding a new style, always check if the same defenition already excists in another file.
- refer to the [SASS documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html) for detials on SASS

#### JS styleguide
- indentation is 4 spaces
- please use camelCase
- please write `/* comment */` for single row comments
- please write
```
/*
 * comments
 * are
 * great
 */
```
  for multirow comments
- don't overdo comments, only write them if necessary to understand a section
- begin each file with a header
```
/*
 * Project ariana
 * File: filename
 * Author: your name
 * Date: date created
 * Description: small description of file
 */
```
- statements
```
if (condition) {
    statements;
}
```
- functions and modules
```
var moduleName = angular.module('moduleName', [
    'resource',
    'resource'
]);

angular.module('moduleName').run(['resource',
    function($resource) {
        statement
    }
]);


```
